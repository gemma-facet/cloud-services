# Let's Train the Model

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to train a model using the Gemma Fine-Tuning Services platform. It covers everything from preparing your dataset to monitoring the training process and evaluating the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

## How to select base model?

## How to select the fine tuning method?

## PEFT or not, that is the question

## How to configure hyperparameters?

## Monitoring Training Progress

## Configuring Evaluation and Export with Training

NOTE: You can also do this separately through export and eval services!

## What's Next?

After setting up and starting your training job, you can monitor its progress through the dashboard. Once the training is complete, you can evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation suite provided in the platform. You can also export the trained model in various formats for deployment. See [Inference, Evaluation, and Export](inference_export.md) for more details.
