# Inference, Evaluation, and Export

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to perform inference, evaluation, and export models using the Gemma Fine-Tuning Services platform. It covers everything from running inference on fine-tuned models to evaluating their performance and exporting them in various formats for deployment.

## Evaluating Model Performance

Evaluation involves:

1. generating responses from the model

2. scoring the responses based on various metrics / validating against the dataset ground truth.

### Built-in Evaluation Suites

### Benchmarking with Custom Datasets

THIS WILL BE SUPPORTED SOON, stay tuned!

### Vibe-checking with running inference

You can compare models soon too!

## Exporting to different formats

1. Format?
2. Destination?
