# Facet AI, LLM fine-tuning for everyone

Developed by two Google Summer of Code students at DeepMind, Facet AI is a no-code web platform to manage the fine-tuning workflows of DeepMind's Gemma 3 family of multimodal models. Handling everything from dataset preprocessing to model export, **Facet AI lets you focus on what matters for your use case, not writing boilerplate code and scrolling through pages of documentations and cookbook.**

We cannot wait to see what you bring to the **Gemmaverse** with Facet AI!

## Background

Cookbooks and Colab notebooks are amazing, except that they don't scale when you have multiple datasets, models, and experiments to track. Facet AI not only provides an open-sourced backend to streamline and centralize all your fine-tuning needs, but also makes it easy for non-technical users to leverage the power of cutting-edge post-training techniques and Google Cloud without writing a single line of code.

### Coming Soon

- More data augmentation for vision and text datasets
- Audio modality support for Gemma 3n
- Full feature plan is tracked in [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/gemma-facet/cloud-services/issues/52)

## Usage

1. Use it for free on our website platform: [https://gemma-facet.vercel.app/](https://gemma-facet.vercel.app/)

2. Deploy the project to your own google cloud project with our Terraform and Cloud Build scripts, see `infrastructure/README.md` for details.

3. Use this as a reference to build your own fine-tuning service since we're fully open source!
